# Wafer_Fault_Detection

Fault detection using mutlimodal machine learning technique in a wafer based sensor array consiting of 590 sensor per wafer. The dataset is incremental load and the code is able to manage the update and retraining of data automatically. Data transformation is also handled internally. This is a course project part of Ineuron Data Science Course.
